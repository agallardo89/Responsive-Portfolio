                    <p>I got my first job at Food Lion working as a cashier, and Later in 2010 landed a Job at UNC  Lenoir Hall as a Accountant. Where it caught me interest on learning to trade the stock market, and with some of the money saved up i invested on Real Estate to flip a House. Now im working as a Project Manager while trade the stock market, and to learn to code at which is something i've always wanted to do.

                    <p> What really passionates me is learn to code and to do outdoor activities; climbing, playing basketball, football, and lift weights. I also enjoy traveling and exploring new places, like Mexico City, Cancun, Guatemala, and look forward to explore more...
